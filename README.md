# Getting Started with Create React App

Hey there! I wanted to share a web app called Grow that I've been using for a couple of months now and have found it really helpful. It's essentially a combination of a task manager, timer/stopwatch like Pomodoro, journal, and habit tracker, but what makes it unique is how seamlessly these features integrate with each other.

For example, let's say I need to study for a CS exam. I can create a task for it, add subtasks, and use tags like 'study', 'engineering', and a label like the course title. Then, I can start the task and a timer/stopwatch will automatically launch. When I'm finished, the timer will stop and those minutes will be added to the task and distributed among the tags. This is just one example, but you can do this with multiple tasks throughout the day.

At the end of the day, the journal feature helps me reflect on my habits (like eating and exercise) and plan for the next day. And the best part is that the tasks I created earlier will already be there, so I can jump right into them the next morning.

Grow is still a work in progress, but I'm really enjoying it so far and thought you might too. Check it out at https://grow.divyb.xyz/Seed and let me know what you think!
